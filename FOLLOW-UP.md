# 1.Implementation:

# Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
The project is developed using existing template called 'CoreUI for Angular 9' which uses angular, font-awesome, ngx-bootstrap, ngx-perfect-scrollbar and many more libraries but not all are actually in use.All mentioned are used for design and user interface.

# Q) What's the command to start the application locally?
Below are the commands defined in package.json to run application.
    -Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change  any of the source files.
    -Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
    -Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests.
    -Run `npm run lint` to execute the souce code through our linting rules.

# 2.General:

# Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would like to add Pre-commit Hooks like husky and Prettier, loader functionality, lodash for performance improvement.Also i would like to remove all unused imports and modules from package.json.There are some improvements i can do like using map operator on observable rather than doing stuff on subscribe function.

# Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I have used model based logic, instead i can add the same functionalities directly to the component file.It makes code more readable and simplified.

# Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Changing the css as per requirment and adding data to the view after co-relating itineraries and legs.

# Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
Test was awesome, instructions were also clear.
